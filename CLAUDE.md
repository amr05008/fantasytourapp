# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Fantasy Grand Tours is a Streamlit web application that displays real-time fantasy cycling competition results by fetching data from the procyclingstats API. The app automatically calculates fantasy team scores based on real professional rider performance.

**Multi-Race Support**: The app supports multiple Grand Tours (Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, Vuelta a España) with a race selector UI. Each race has:
- Dynamic leader jersey colors (🟡 Yellow for TDF, 🟣 Pink for Giro, 🔴 Red for Vuelta)
- Race-specific configurations (dates, stages, rosters)
- Shareable URLs via query parameters (e.g., `?race=tdf-2025`)
- Mobile-optimized horizontal race selector

The app features stage-by-stage analysis charts, comprehensive progress tracking, and adaptive theming based on the selected Grand Tour.

## Running the Application

### Start Development Server
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Auto-refresh Feature
The app automatically refreshes data every 5 minutes using Streamlit's caching mechanism with TTL (Time-To-Live).

## Data Architecture

### Procyclingstats API Integration

The app fetches real race data from procyclingstats.com using the `procyclingstats` Python package:

**How Fantasy Scoring Works:**
- Each fantasy team consists of 3-8 professional riders (configured in `team_config.py`)
- Team score = Sum of all riders' cumulative times from the General Classification (GC)
- Lower total time = Better score (like real cycling)
- Only active riders count (DNF/DNS riders are marked but excluded from totals)

### Configuration Files

1. **races_config.py**: Multi-race configuration (primary)
   ```python
   RACES = {
       "tdf-2025": {
           "id": "tdf-2025",
           "name": "Tour de France 2025",
           "short_name": "TDF 2025",
           "race_url": "race/tour-de-france/2025",
           "total_stages": 21,
           "leader_color": "#FFD700",  # Yellow jersey
           "leader_jersey_emoji": "🟡",
           "start_date": "2025-07-05",
           "end_date": "2025-07-27",
           "is_complete": True,
           "winner": "Aaron",
           "completion_date": "July 27, 2025"
       },
       # ... other races (giro-2026, tdf-2026, vuelta-2026)
   }

   TEAM_ROSTERS = {
       "tdf-2025": {
           "Jeremy": ["rider/sepp-kuss", "rider/jhonatan-narvaez", ...],
           "Leo": ["rider/felix-gall", "rider/kevin-vauquelin", ...],
           # ... other participants
       },
       # ... other races
   }
   ```
   - Each race has metadata, team rosters, and completion status
   - Helper functions: `get_race_config()`, `get_team_rosters()`, `get_all_races()`
   - Database-ready structure for future Phase 4 migration

2. **team_config.py**: Backwards compatibility shim
   - Imports from `races_config.py` but maintains old API
   - Exists for legacy code compatibility
   - New code should import from `races_config.py` directly

2. **api_client.py**: API interaction layer
   - `fetch_fantasy_standings()`: Get current standings with calculated team scores
   - `fetch_stage_by_stage_data()`: Get historical data for all stages (charts)
   - `fetch_stage_gc()`: Get General Classification for a specific stage
   - `calculate_team_time()`: Sum rider times for each fantasy team
   - All functions use Streamlit `@st.cache_data` with 5-minute TTL

### Time Conversion System

The app uses a two-way conversion system for time calculations:

- `time_str_to_seconds()` (api_client.py): Converts `H:MM:SS` or `HH:MM:SS` strings to integer seconds
- `seconds_to_time_str()` (api_client.py): Converts seconds back to human-readable format
- `calculate_time_gap()` (app.py): Computes time differences relative to the leader

This allows for accurate gap calculations and proper sorting/ranking.

### Data Flow

1. **Fetch GC Data**: For each stage, scrape General Classification from procyclingstats.com
2. **Calculate Team Scores**: Sum cumulative times for all riders on each fantasy team
3. **Sort Teams**: Rank teams by total time (ascending - lower is better)
4. **Calculate Gaps**: Compute time gaps from leader
5. **Display**: Show standings, charts, and rider details in UI
6. **Caching**: All API responses cached for 5 minutes via Streamlit decorators

## Competition Configuration

The app has a configuration-based system for toggling between active and completed competition states:

```python
COMPETITION_CONFIG = {
    "is_complete": True,          # Toggle competition completion status
    "winner_name": "Aaron",        # Name of winner (shown when complete)
    "competition_name": "Tour de France 2025",
    "total_stages": 21,
    "completion_date": "July 27, 2025",
    "show_celebration": True       # Toggle winner celebration banner
}
```

Located at app.py:89. This allows easy reuse for future competitions (e.g., Tour de France 2026) by simply updating these values.

## UI Components and Features

### Three-Tab Navigation System

1. **🏆 Current Standings**: Main leaderboard with yellow jersey styling for the leader
2. **📊 Stage Analysis**: Interactive Plotly charts showing:
   - Cumulative Time Progression (line chart)
   - Individual Stage Performance (bar chart)
   - Gap Evolution Analysis (line chart tracking gaps over time)
3. **👥 Team Riders**: Shows each participant's drafted professional riders with team-colored cards

### Dark Mode Theme

The app uses a dark-only theme (no toggle):
- Background: `#1e1e1e`
- Cards: `#2d2d2d`
- Text: White with high contrast
- Leader styling: Yellow jersey gold (`#FFD700`) optimized for dark backgrounds

All CSS is embedded in the Streamlit app using `st.markdown()` with `unsafe_allow_html=True`.

### Winner Celebration System

When `COMPETITION_CONFIG["is_complete"] = True`:
- `create_winner_banner()` function (app.py:131) displays an animated gold gradient banner
- Leader card shows "🏆 CHAMPION" instead of "LEADER"
- Page title shows "COMPLETE ✅" status
- Confetti animation and pulsing effects

### Responsive Design

The app includes comprehensive mobile responsiveness:
- CSS media queries for tablets (≤768px) and phones (≤480px)
- Touch-friendly 44px minimum touch targets
- Adaptive column layouts that stack vertically on mobile
- Disabled hover effects on touch devices
- Optimized typography and chart scaling for small screens

### Social Media Sharing

Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and Schema.org metadata are embedded in the HTML head (app.py:18-70) for rich link previews when sharing the app URL via text message or social media.

## Key Functions and Data Flow

1. **API Data Retrieval**: Fetch General Classification data from procyclingstats.com via Stage API
2. **Team Score Calculation**: Sum cumulative times for all riders on each fantasy team
3. **Time Conversion**: Convert time strings to seconds for calculations and comparisons
4. **Gap Calculation**: Calculate time differences relative to leader
5. **Display Formatting**: Convert back to human-readable format for UI display
6. **Caching**: All API responses and processed data cached for 5 minutes via Streamlit decorators
7. **Rider Details**: Show individual rider GC positions and times in Team Riders tab

## Dependencies

Core packages (listed in `requirements.txt`):
- `streamlit`: Web framework and UI components
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis

- **Caching**: 5-minute cache TTL balances performance and data freshness
- **The competition tracks 5 participants across 21 stages of the Tour de France**
- **User prefers simple, everyday language (noted in replit.md:9)**

## Testing

Run integration tests to verify API connection and data fetching:

```bash
# Test API integration
python3 test_integration.py

# Expected output: Current standings with team scores
```

## Configuration Updates

### To change team rosters:
Edit `team_config.py` and update the `TEAM_ROSTERS` dictionary with rider URLs from procyclingstats.com

### To use a different race:
Edit `team_config.py` and update `RACE_CONFIG`:
```python
RACE_CONFIG = {
    "race_url": "race/giro-d-italia/2026",
    "race_name": "Giro d'Italia 2026",
    "total_stages": 21
}
```
